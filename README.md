# ENPM661 Project 2

To run this project, download all files. Run `main.py`. The program will prompt you for its run parameters - Robot type (point or rigid), maze type (trial or final), start coordinates (x y), and goal coordinates (x y). When you have finished with the parameters, the program will run. In the worst possible configuration (start and goal in opposite corners), the trial maze solves in about 3 minutes. The final maze, from (5,5) to (295, 195), solves in approx 32 minutes. The final maze with a rigid robot solves in about 4 minutes. 

The program will generate a .AVI file in the same directory, which is the animation of the solution.
